         <p>I am a senior at Bob Jones University studying Cross-Cultural Service with a focus in counseling. I work for SC Home Offer as an independent contractor flipping houses.</p>

            I enjoy getting involved in college, spending time with my friends, and playing sports. I attend Beth Haven Baptist Church and occasionally help out with the saturday Bible club.
